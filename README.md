# Health-Disease-Prediction-System
A machine learning-based project for predicting **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson’s Disease**.  
It includes **data visualization**, **model training** using algorithms like **SVM** and **Logistic Regression**, and a **user-friendly interface** for making predictions.

This project is divided into two parts:  
- **Part A:** Data Visualization  
- **Part B:** Model Training & Prediction Web App
